                <h3>&#9776; 1810s</h3>
                <p>Lord Byron wrote the poem "Fare Thee Well" to his wife Lady Byron in 1816, following their separation
                    after the birth of Ada Lovelace.</p>

                <h3>&#9776; 1970s</h3>
                <p>Lovelace is portrayed in Romulus Linney's 1977 play Childe Byron.</p>

                <h3>&#9776; 1990s</h3>
                <p>In the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling,[92] Lovelace
                    delivers a lecture on the "punched cards" programme which proves two theorems, a discovery that, in
                    reality, was not made until 1931 by Kurt Gödel.

                    In the 1997 film Conceiving Ada,[93] a computer scientist obsessed with Ada finds a way of
                    communicating with her in the past by means of "undying information waves".

                    In Tom Stoppard's 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly—a character
                    "apparently based" on Ada Lovelace (the play also involves Lord Byron)—comes to understand chaos
                    theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.</p>

                <h3>&#9776; 2000s</h3>
                <p>Lovelace features in John Crowley's 2005 novel, Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land, as an unseen
                    character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to
                    archive her father's lost novel.</p>

                <h3>&#9776; 2020s</h3>
                <p>Lovelace features as a character in "Spyfall, Part 2", the second episode of Doctor Who, series 12,
                    which first aired on BBC One on 5 January 2020.[105] The character was portrayed by Sylvie Briggs,
                    alongside characterisations of Charles Babbage and Noor Inayat Khan. In 2021, Nvidia named their
                    upcoming GPU architecture (to be released in 2022), "Ada Lovelace", after her.</p>
